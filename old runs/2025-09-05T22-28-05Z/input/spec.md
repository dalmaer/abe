# Where Is My Car? (Parking Tracker)

## Description
Design a simple mobile UI with two screens:
1) **Save Spot** — large level buttons (e.g., P0, P1, P2, P3), plus text field to add a custom label (e.g., "Street + Cross").
2) **Find Car** — shows the last saved spot, big contrasty "Navigate" call to action, and a small history list.

## Type
Mobile application UI (iOS/Android agnostic, but feel native).

## Styles
- Warm palette with a red accent, subtle depth shadows, rounded cards, bold H1.
- Keep main actions one-tap reachable.

## Models

## Critique Criteria
- Task success (clarity of "Save" + "Find")
- Visual hierarchy & tap targets
- Accessibility (contrast, touch area)
- Consistency across screens

## Notes
Prefer a simple layout that beginners can grok instantly.
