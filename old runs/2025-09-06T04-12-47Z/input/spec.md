# Dogfood Feeding Tracker

## Description
Design a family-friendly mobile app with clean screens to track dog feeding times:
1) **Feed Status** — shows today's feeding status with clear morning/evening indicators, last fed time, and which family member fed the dog
2) **Feed Log** — button to mark dog as fed (morning/evening) with family member selection, plus feeding history/calendar view
3) **Settings** — family member management and notification preferences

## Type
Mobile application UI (iOS/Android friendly, family-oriented design)

## Notes
Prioritize clarity to prevent double-feeding accidents. Design should be intuitive for family members of all ages.
